        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe makes some crispy and healthy toasted taco shells loaded with freshly made tomato salsa and well spiced ground beef, topped with creamy guacamole and savory cheese. These Ground Beef Tacos will be your perfect meal for lunch or dinner!</p>
        <p>My pro tip is to magically turn soft taco shells crunchy by using a toaster! Simply fold a tortilla into half and pop the tortilla into the toaster like a slice of bread. Make sure your tortilla is not significantly larger than your toaster slots. I used 6 inch tortillas. They fit in my toaster perfectly.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>Taco seasoning</li>
            <li>Soft or hard taco shells</li>
            <li>Shredded cheese of your choice (I like the fiesta blend!)</li>
            <li>Lettuce or spinach</li>
            <li>1 medium sized tomato</li>
            <li>Guacamole, salsa, or sour cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put ground beef in a pan over medium heat and cook until browned</li>
            <li>While ground beef is cooking, dice up your tomato and prepare lettuce</li>
            <li>When ground beef is done cooking toast your taco shells in the toaster or oven for a couple minutes</li>
            <li>Load ingredients into toasted shell and top off with shredded cheese and guacomole, salsa, or sour cream</li>
        </ol>
