        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is one of my favorites! Quick and easy with only a few ingredients. I call it dog food because I know people that will fix this up for their pups. Don't let the name scare you away, it tastes better than it sounds.</p>
        <p>With only some white rice, ground beef, and a few different seasonings you'll be on your way to having a delicious, nutritious, filling, and easy to make meal.</p>
